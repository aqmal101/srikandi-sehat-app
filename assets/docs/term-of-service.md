## AGREEMENT TO OUR LEGAL TERMS

I am **Ipincamp** (“we,” “us,” “our”), a developer in **Purwokerto, Banyumas, Indonesia**.

We operate the mobile application **Srikandi Sehat** (the "App"), as well as any other related products and services that refer or link to these legal terms (the "Legal Terms") (collectively, the "Services").

By downloading and using the Srikandi Sehat app, you agree to our Terms of Service. This app serves as an educational tool for tracking menstrual cycles and is not intended as a substitute for professional medical advice. We collect the cycle and symptom data you provide to operate key features and request your location permission for scientific research on the influence of environmental factors on adolescent menstrual cycles. We guarantee that all data used for research will be fully anonymized and analyzed in aggregate to protect your privacy. For more detailed information, please refer to our Privacy Policy document.

Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Services from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Legal Terms at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of these Legal Terms, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review these Legal Terms to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Legal Terms by your continued use of the Services after the date such revised Legal Terms are posted.

The Services are intended for users who are at least 13 years of age. All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside (generally under the age of 18) must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, their parent or guardian to use the Services.
